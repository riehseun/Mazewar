Instruction to run:
1. Open a terminal and run:
      make
   in the mazewar directory.

2. Run the server by running: 
      java MazewarServer [port]
   where port is the TCP port you are running on.
   
   You can also run the server.sh script to start the server on port 4444.

3. Open another terminal and start the client with the command: 
      java Mazewar [IP] [port]
   where IP is the ip address of the server and port is the TCP port the server is running on.

   You can also run the client.sh script to start the client and connect to the server on localhost:4444

   DO NOT move the client (hit any keys) until all clients have connected or the game will be inconsistent.

4. Repeat step 3 until you have 4 running clients.

5. Play the game :)
